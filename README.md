# Resident Evil 4 Java

## Introduction
This is a techdemo of Resident Evil games from the PSX era running on Java/JME Engine.
This is not a direct conversion. Instead, the game logic is written in Java using a try and error approach, only using the Assets from the original games.

The objective of this project is not to create a total conversion of any classic RE games.
The main goal is to implement the basic logic of those games, serving as showcase and example to other developers that want to create classic survival horror games using pre-rendered scenarios.

## Development Environment
Uses JME3 3.3
The optimal development environment is achieved by using the official SDK release, 3.3+
https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases
